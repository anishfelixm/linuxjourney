  The **Shell** is a computer program which takes commands from the keyboard and sends to the Operating system to execute. System programs such as "_terminal_" or "_console_" launch a shell for you. Most Linux distributions have a shell called ***bash***, which stands for **B**ourne **A**gain **Sh**ell. There are other shell programs as well like zsh, tsh, etc.

  When a shell is opened the prompt may look like :
>pete@icebox:/home/pete $
The "$" symbol points to normal user and varying on distribution and user access other symbols may be used. There's no need to add the symbol before a command since the symbol will be there.

**pwd**
  Everything in Linux is a file organized in a hierarchical order. The 1st or topmost directory is the root directory, represented by "/". The location to the files and folders is called path. It's useful to know the path so that you can navigate using terminal itself. To find path to current file, use the ***pwd*** command. pwd stands for "print working directory".
Syntax:
$pwd
/home/user/Desktop

**cd**
