  Linux origins is inspired by the **UNIX operating system** developed in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories. The GNU project, which stands for *GNU is Not Unix*; lead to the creation of the __GNU General Public License__ (GPL), a free software license which made a path for linux development.
The Kernel is the most important part of the operating system. It allows the hardware to talk to the software and is the interface by which applications get access to use the computer processor. 

In 1991, **Linus Torvalds** developed the Linux Kernel.

A Linux System has 3 parts : 
- Hardware
- Linux kernel
- User space
Systems that use the Linux kernel are called Linux Operating Systems. Some popular distributions are : 
+ Debian 
  Free and Open source OS in running for past 20 years. 3 versions : stable, testing and unstable. Best to be working with stable version. Testing and Unstable are rolling releases. Uses Debian package management tools to manage linux distribution packages. It's a good "core" OS and can run on most platforms.
+ Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  Commonly called as RHEL, developed by Red Hat. Strict rules with Re-distribution but the source code is free and open. RHEL uses RPM Package Manager. Mostly used in enterprise and is good for developments that involve a server OS.
+ Ubuntu
  Most popular Linux based Personal machine OS. Has its own Desktop manager called Unity, which comes by default. It's a Debian based OS built by Canonical and hence uses Debian based Package Manager. Great for any platform and is best Linux system for beginners.
+ Fedora
  Backed by Red Hat, but is open source and free. Uses Red Hat Package Manager. Good for PC systems. RHEL branches off of Fedora.
+ Linux Mint
  Based off Ubuntu. It's like a lighter distribution of Ubuntu and both have same package repositories. Since based on Ubuntu -> uses Debian Package manager. Good for beginners.
+ Gentoo
  Offers extreme flexibility but built for advanced users. Gentoo package manager is Portage. Portage is very modular which helps the system be very  flexibile. Good on personal devices.
+ ArchLinux
  It's lightweight and flexible and is 100% maintained by the open source community. May require high level coding and understanding but gives complete control over the system. Has package manager called Pacman. May have a difficult learning curve but to master Linux it's probably the best one to learn. Good with personal devices and Embedded devices that require a lightweight OS.
+ openSUSE
  Part of the OpenSUSE project, a community that promotes use of Linux everwhere as part of the Worldwide free and Open Source Software community. It's the 2nd oldest Linux distribution still in use and uses the RPM package manager. Has a graphical installation and administration application called YaST and a tiday base system. Has everything needed for a smooth linux system that's virus protected for a beginner.
